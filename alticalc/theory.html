<h1>About the AltiCalc Calculator</h1>
<h2>Altitude Tracking</h2>
    <section>
<p class="para">/*Describe AltiTrak w/o using the word AlitTrak?*/
 You can use this angle to estimate the height of the rocket by
assuming that the rocket went straight up into the sky.  This isn't a
particularly bad assumption, but in windy weather, you could be off
by a significant amount.</p>
<p class="para">To correct for this
inaccuracy, you need to get more information about the rocket's
trajectory.  One of the most common methods of tracking rockets is by
using two theodolites.  A theodolite not only measures the angle
above the horizon (the altitude angle), but also the angle the rocket
has moved horizontally (the azimuth angle).  With two theodolites,
you can determine the final altitude with very good accuracy.</p>
<p class="para">The problem with
theodolites is that they are more expensive than AltiTraks and it is
much easier to make your own AltiTrak-like device that it is to make
your own theodolite.  Simply tape a weighted string to a protractor
and you have a crude device to measure altitude angle.  AltiCalc
provides a way to track rockets accurately with only altitude angle
measurements.</p>
<h2>The Theory Behind AltiCalc</h2>
<p class="para">Again consider the lone
person with an AltiTrak.  Imagine an infinite ray stretching out of
the tracking device towards the rocket.  This represents the locus of
points that the rocket could occupy given only that the tracker has
it in their sights.  Since we don't know the azimuth angle in which
the tracker is facing, this ray could point in any direction as long
as it has the same altitude angle.  This forms a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone#Right_circular_cone" 
title="Right Circular Cone (Wikipedia)">right cone</a> around the
tracker. [show gif]</p>
<p class="para">The AltiCalc program
takes advantage of the fact that right cones aligned on parallel axes
will intersect.  More specifically, given three non-colinear right
cones whose their apexes are on the xy-plane and whose axes are
parallel to the z-axis, the only intersections of all three cones
will be at a unique z-value.  The equations involved in this method
cannot be solved analytically, so a numerical solver is used instead.</p>
<p class="para">The
solver works as follows:  
</p>
<ol class="list">
	<li>A z-value guess is selected<a class="footnotelink" name="footnote1src" href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
	<li>The cones are sliced at that height to yield three circles [add
	example]
	<li>The x-value of the intersections between cones 1 &amp; 2 and cones 1
	&amp; 3 are computed.  (If the intersections don't exist, nothing is
	computed)</li>
	<li>If the intersection of 1 &amp; 2 is to the left of cones 1 &amp; 3,
	a bigger guess is selected.  If it is to the right, a smaller guess
	is selected.</li>
	<li>This process continues until either</li>
	<ol class="list loweralpha">
		<li>The intersection of cones 1 &amp; 2 is at the same 
		place<a class="footnotelink" name="footnote2src" href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
		as cones 1 &amp; 3</li>
		<li>The guesses get too close to the edges of the allowable range of
		guesses.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul class="list">
	<li>The elevation of each tracking device is at	the same elevation as the launch pad.</li>
	<li>The x-y plane is defined as this elevation,	with z directed upward</li>
	<li>The trackers are arranged along the x-axis.</li>
</ul>
